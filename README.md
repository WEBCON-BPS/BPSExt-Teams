Plugins package for WEBCON BPS and Teams integration.

This package contains three actions: CreateTeamsChannel, AddAttachmentsToPrivateChannel and AddAttachmentsToPublicChannel.
The first one creates a team with one channel and adds to it all users who have access to the current workflow instance.
The other two "AddAttachments(…)” actions work identically from the end user's perspective.
The difference is that attachments in private channels are stored by additional SharePoint sites, so there are a few additional operations to be performed in the code.

Please note that this is just a sample plugin, delivered under attached license.

Note: Using SDK plugins in WEBCON BPS may require a specific license depending on the version being used.

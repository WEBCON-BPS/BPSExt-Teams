Plugins package for WEBCON BPS and Teams integration.

This package contains two actions: CreateTeamsChannel and AddAttachmentsToChannel.
The first one creates a team with one channel and adds to it all users who have access to the current workflow instance.
The second action adds attachment to channel. Form version 2025, it makes no difference if the channel is public or private.

Please note that this is just a sample plugin, delivered under attached license.

Note: Using SDK plugins in WEBCON BPS may require a specific license depending on the version being used.
